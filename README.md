## Forever thankful :)
Already 24 days into 2020 and it feels like time is just flying by! It feels like just yesterday that I traveled with firends and its already been 2months. I spend so much time visiting so many different places that I lose track of time. I’m very lucky to have been able to travel so much. To learn so much about other cultures and people. To become a more accepting individual because each place is so different to another that you have no choice but to learn how to adapt. It’s been overwhelming, fun, emotional, taxing and wonderful experience ever. Been 5 years since I’ve made it a point to incorporate travel in my life in some way and I’m so glad that I did :)
